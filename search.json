    "text": "Overview\nThis course aims at making Bioconductor package development at one’s reach. It is specifically designed for biologists and newer bioinformaticians who may find themselves using R/Bioconductor packages and who wish to expand their programatic toolkit.\nOverall, this course will help the attendees gain accurate insights in the fundamental notions required for proper R/Bioconductor package development. We will cover key theory concepts about package development and Bioconductor ecosystem, supported by a range of demonstration and exercises, to get a complete understanding of all the steps of package development.\nThroughout this workshop, we will put an emphasis on the best practices for developing a package embedded in the R/Bioconductor ecosystem."

    "text": "Format\nThe course is structured in modules over five days. Each day will contain a mix of formal lectures, demonstration, and hands-on exercises.\n\nFormal lectures will cover the key theory required to understand the principles of package development (~2h).\nFollowing these lectures, practical examples will be shown to illustrate how to translate the acquired knowledge into a real-life R/Bioconductor package. At this stage, trainees will get acquainted with state-of-the-art Bioconductor ecosystem as well as the best coding practices in bioinformatics.\nDuring the rest of the daily sessions, trainees will work by themselves, following guided exercises to practice their package development skills. Hints and solution are provided for each exercise. The exercises will mainly focus on specific concepts introduced earlier that day.\n\nOffice hours will take place during the last hour of the exercises. An instructor will be available to answer individual questions related to daily exercises.\nA Slack channel will also be available so that Q&A are available for everybody."

However, the course will be mostly beneficial to those who have already been familiarized to the R environment.\nThe requirements for this course are:\n\nKnowledge of next-generation sequencing data processing and formats;\nBasic programming experience in R (writing a function, variable types, loading packages);\nWorking knowledge of Unix / command line interface (managing files, running programs, reading manuals!) is recommended (basic bash commands cd, ls, cp, …), though is not formally required;\nBioconductor experience is a plus, though is not formally required."

    "text": "About the instructor\nJacques owns a PhD in Genomics from Cambridge University (UK). His formal training is in experimental biology, which means that he understands the challenges and issues associated with bench troubleshooting and optimization. However, his primary focus shifted towards large-scale genomic analysis years ago, and he now has a deep knowledge of the range of genome-wide datasets (bulk and single-cell!) that are available out there.\nBecause he originally comes from the bench, the examples demonstrated in this course will be designed from “real-life” situations. You may even find yourself using the package you will create during this course for your own analyses!\njacques dot serizay at pasteur dot fr"
